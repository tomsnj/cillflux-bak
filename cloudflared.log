You did not specify any valid additional argument to the cloudflared tunnel command.

If you are trying to run a Quick Tunnel then you need to explicitly pass the --url flag.
Eg. cloudflared tunnel --url localhost:8080/.

Please note that Quick Tunnels are meant to be ephemeral and should only be used for testing purposes.
For production usage, we recommend creating Named Tunnels. (https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/)
